# Is java an interpreter or compiler?

Java is both an interpreter and a compiler. The Compiler of java called as javac converts source code into an Intermediate file known as Bytecode file. The Bytecode file is unique for all types of OS means bytecode is platform-independent. The Interpreter of java (java) converts Bytecode into the specific OS-compatible machine code. This code will vary according to OS.
